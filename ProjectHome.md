3Seashells is specifically useful for queuing a list of graphic actions to be taken, and then executed by a Renderer.

Additional work to abstract the Flash Graphics class behind a generic 'canvas' is being implemented (completed for ActionScript 3) and will provide a framework for graphic rendering that allow ActionScript developers to deploy anywhere (read: iPhone, HTML5, etc.)

Our goal is to have the 3 seashells be more or less three C Shells for rendering any canvas, but targeting ObjectivE-C (iOS), HTML5 canvas and Flash Graphics (as in Shape.graphics or Sprite.graphics).

For additional project information, and to contribute your own theory of the "Three Seashells" (from **Demolition Man**), see our blog at http://blog.3seashells.com our our main site at http://www.3seashells.com.

Other Libraries that build on top of 3Seashells:

HeavyFlash (an extension 3Seashells and an extension of the 'flash' and 'flash.geom' packages).  Used for trig and math/flash heavy rendering.
RollingThunder (ActionSCript component factory framework built on 3Seashells, HeavyFlash, TextScript and TileScript)
TextScript (an ActionScript text effect engine)
TileScript (an ActionScript graphic transitions engine)
